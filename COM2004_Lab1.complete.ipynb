      "## Objectives\n",
      "\n",
      "* To provide an introduction to iPython notebook.\n",
      "* To introduce a classification task using real data.\n",

      "The following instructions will install iPython Notebook and open the notebook for this week's lab class. Follow them carefully and put up your hand if you get stuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Boot your machine as a CICS Windows desktop and log in.\n",
      "2. Start 'Software Centre' using the desktop icon\n",
      "3. Search for and install Python-2.7 and iPython-Notebook-2.7\n",
      "4. Launch iPython Notebook from the Windows Start menu\n",
      "5. Find COM2004_Lab1.ipynb in lab section of MOLE\n",
      "6. Right click on the link and 'save target as...'. Save to the deskop\n",
      "7. In the web browser find the IPython Dashboard tab\n",

      "# What is an iPython notebook?\n",
      "\n",
      "iPython is the interactive python shell, i.e. it is a command window into which you can directly type and evaluation Python expressions and programs. The iPython Notebook builds on this idea by using a web browser as an interface to a Python kernel. Web browsers are convenient because they provide all the machinary necessary for displaying code and graphical output. They also make it possible for the interactive client and the python kernel to be running on different machines connected via the web. \n",
      "\n",
      "The browser provides an interface to a notebook. A notebook is built of components called `cells` which either contain text elements or python code. This is ideal for lab classes because it means code examples and exercises can be embedded directly in the lab sheet. You'll see that some cells contain code already, in other places there are blank cells in which you will need to either fill in gaps or try ideas of your own.  iPython notebooks are also being widely used in research. For researchers they provide a convenient way to distribute reproducible research, i.e. the code to run experiments can be embedded in the report that describes them. \n",

      "\n",
      "To execute the code in the next cell,\n",

      "1. simply click on the cell so that it becomes the current cell (a green border should appear around it)\n",

      "***Python***: We have been introduced to iPython notebook and have used it to explore a small medical data set. We have seen how Python can store data in a matrix and how the data can be manipulated using a simple syntax. We have seen some of matplotlib's powerful plotting functions and used them to visualize some 1-D and 2-D data distributions using histograms and scatter plots.\n",
      "\n",
      "***Classification***: We have been introduced to a simple classification task based on the diagnosis of liver disease using patient data. We have seen that for real world tasks it can be hard to find single features that clearly separate the classes we are interested in. We have seen that using more that one feature at a time can be a way of better separating the classes (i.e. the data in the scatter plots was less overlapped that the data in the histograms).\n",

      "\n",
      "* To gain experience with some more advanced Python programming features: passing functions as parameters; defining 'anonymous\u2019 functions.\n",
      "* To see how numerical integration can be used to approximate the mean and variance of a distribution.\n",

      "## 1. Background ##\n",
      "\n",
      "In the lecture notes we have seen that expectations of continuous random variables (e.g. means and variances) can be computed from the probability density function by integration. In the lectures we have used \u2018analytic\u2019 integration to derive exact expressions for the mean and variance of the Gaussian distribution and the uniform distribution. Sometimes integration can be hard to perform analytically. In such cases we can resort to approximate numerical techniques to compute the mean and variance. There are two main approaches we can take, i/ monte-carlo sampling:\n",
      "(i.e. generating samples from the distribution and computing their statistics directly). ii/ integration by numerical quadrature, (i.e. approximating the area under a curve by cutting it into a finite number of slithers that we then sum up). Quadrature works very well for 1-D problem and will be the focus of this lab class.\n",

      "\n",
      "## 2. Introduction ##\n",
      "\n",
      "Numerical quadrature is a form of numerical integration and can be used to integrate functions between definite limits, i.e. finding the area under a curve between a lower and upper limit on the x-axis. There are several different versions of the technique but they all work in the same way. The area under the curve is approximated by summing a series of segments whose area is easy to compute. In the simplest case the segments are very thin rectangles, e.g. in the figure overleaf, the area under the curve can be approximated by summing the area of each of the rectangles shown. Note that the width of each rectangle is some fixed step size, and the heights are calculated by evaluating the function f(x) at the x position where the rectangle is centered. The area of each is simply the width times the height.\n",
      "\n",
      "The more rectangles we use, the thinner they will be and the closer the sum of their areas will be to the true area under the curve. i.e. by summing more rectangles we can improve the precision of the approximation \u2013 at the expense of additional computational effort.\n",

      "In this lab class you\u2019ll be using data that represents the weights and lengths of male and female **Bengal tigers**. In order to build classifiers we are going to want to be able to estimate the means (i.e. averages), variances and covariance of these measurements. In order to discover the true means and variances we\u2019d have to catch and measure every one of the roughly 2,500 tigers that are thought to exist \u2013 a project that is clearly impractical. So, instead we will have to be satisfied with an **estimate** of the true mean and variance that we generate by looking at the statistics of a small **sample** of tigers (e.g. we might catch and measure 20 animals). This is generally always going to be the case: we will be interested in the statistics of a large population, but we will have to make do with estimates derived from a smaller \u2013 often much smaller \u2013 sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In Part 1 of this lab class** we will be using Python to find out what happens when we try to compute estimates of statistics using small samples. We will see how the reliability of the estimates improves as the sample size increases. We will also see how estimates of variance and covariance can be biased (i.e. systematically too small or too large) if we don\u2019t handle the sample correctly.\n",

When we take our sample we form an estimate of the mean. So when we estimate variance we are computing the distance of points to the estimated mean not the true mean. The estimated mean is going to be at the centre of our sample and will always be closer to the sample points than the true mean. This is seen clearly by taking the extreme case of a sample size of 1. For a single point the sample mean will always be the sample itself, i.e. the distance to the sample mean is 0 so the sample variance is 0 --- which is clearly a severe underestimate of the true variance. )\n",
